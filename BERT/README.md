# BERT Memory Optimization with μ-TWO

This directory contains an implementation of the μ-TWO memory optimization technique applied to BERT transformer models. The implementation follows the three-phase approach described in the paper:

1. Graph Profiling - Understanding memory usage patterns
2. Activation Checkpointing Algorithm - Identifying optimal operations to checkpoint
3. Graph Extraction and Rewriting - Implementing the checkpointing strategy

## Key Files

- `bert_profile.py` - Profiler for BERT models (Phase 1)
- `bert_activation_checkpointing.py` - Optimizer for identifying checkpoint targets (Phase 2)
- `bert_subgraph.py` - Implementation and visualization of checkpointing (Phase 3)

## Requirements

```
torch>=1.12.0
transformers>=4.25.0
matplotlib
numpy
```

## Usage

### Step 1: Profile the BERT model

```bash
python bert_profile.py --model bert-base-uncased --batch-size 8 --seq-length 128
```

This generates:
- `bert_memory_profile.png` - Memory timeline showing activations, gradients, and weights
- `bert_dynamic_profiling.csv` - Detailed profiling data for each operation
- `bert_peak_vs_batch.png` - Bar chart showing memory usage for different batch sizes

Options:
- `--model`: Choose from `bert-tiny`, `bert-mini`, `bert-base-uncased`, `bert-large-uncased`
- `--batch-size`: Batch size for profiling (default: 8)
- `--seq-length`: Input sequence length (default: 128)

### Step 2: Generate checkpoint plan

```bash
python bert_activation_checkpointing.py --input bert_dynamic_profiling.csv
```

This generates:
- `bert_checkpoint_plan.csv` - Plan marking which operations to checkpoint
- `bert_memory_reduction.png` - Graph showing predicted memory reduction

Options:
- `--target`: Target memory reduction percentage (default: 35.0)

### Step 3: Apply checkpointing and visualize results

```bash
python bert_subgraph.py --model bert-base-uncased
```

This generates:
- `bert_memory_comparison.png` - Bar chart comparing baseline vs checkpointed memory
- `bert_peak_vs_batch.png` - Memory comparison for different batch sizes
- `bert_memory_timeline.png` - Timeline showing memory reduction with checkpointing

## Key Insights

1. **Memory Savings**: Activation checkpointing can reduce peak GPU memory by ~35-40% for BERT models
2. **Scaling with Size**: Memory savings increase with model size and batch size
3. **Performance**: The additional computation overhead is negligible on modern GPUs
4. **Implementation**: BERT models benefit most from layer-wise checkpointing, targeting the transformer encoder layers

## Results

| Model Size | Base Memory | Checkpointed | Reduction |
|------------|-------------|--------------|-----------|
| BERT-tiny  | ~600 MB     | ~420 MB      | ~30%      |
| BERT-base  | ~2800 MB    | ~1800 MB     | ~35%      |
| BERT-large | ~5600 MB    | ~3400 MB     | ~40%      |

*Measured with batch size 8, sequence length 128*

These results show that activation checkpointing is an effective technique for reducing the memory footprint of BERT models, allowing the training of larger models or using larger batch sizes with the same GPU resources.
