# Final Report: Activation Checkpointing in Neural Networks
## ML Memory Profiler, Spring 2024
### Sylvester Cardorelle

## 1. Introduction

In this project, I implemented activation checkpointing (AC) to address the critical memory constraints that limit neural network training. Modern neural networks require significant GPU memory, particularly for storing activations during the forward pass for use in backpropagation. As model sizes continue to grow exponentially while GPU memory increases only linearly, memory optimization becomes essential for advancing deep learning research and applications.

My implementation focuses on the μ-TWO activation checkpointing algorithm, which strategically reduces memory consumption by selectively discarding activations during the forward pass and recomputing them during the backward pass. This creates a computation-memory trade-off that can significantly reduce peak memory requirements, enabling the training of larger models or increasing batch sizes on memory-constrained hardware.

The project was implemented in three phases:
1. Development of a comprehensive memory profiler that constructs a computational graph and tracks memory usage
2. Implementation of the activation checkpointing algorithm from μ-TWO
3. Creation of a subgraph extractor and rewriter to handle activation recomputation

Using both ResNet and Transformer architectures as test cases, I've demonstrated significant memory savings with minimal computational overhead, enabling larger batch sizes and more efficient training.

## 2. Problems Tackled

- **Graph Construction and Profiling**: I needed to construct a comprehensive computational graph that captures all operations in a training iteration and collects memory usage statistics.

- **Memory Optimization Strategy**: I needed to implement the μ-TWO algorithm to identify which activations to checkpoint based on memory and computational profiles.

- **Subgraph Extraction and Rewriting**: I needed to develop a system that can extract subgraphs for recomputation and rewrite the computational graph to incorporate these recomputations.

- **Architecture-Specific Optimization**: I needed to adapt the checkpointing strategy to the unique characteristics of both CNN and Transformer architectures.

- **Evaluation and Benchmarking**: I needed to quantify the memory savings and computational overhead of my implementation across different batch sizes and model architectures.

## 3. Technical Description

### Computational Graph Profiler

**a) Problem framing**: Neural network training involves numerous operations with complex dependencies. Understanding memory usage requires constructing a graph that captures these operations and tracking how memory flows through the model.

**b) High-level solution**: I implemented a hook-based approach that intercepts operations at key points in PyTorch models. These hooks collect data on computation time and memory usage for each operation, categorize tensors by type, and track activation lifetimes.

**c) Deeper details**: The profiler captures memory usage patterns through the entire training process:

- **Memory tracking by tensor type**: For each operation, the profiler tracks memory used by weights, gradients, and activations.
- **Activation lifetime analysis**: The profiler records when each activation is first created and last used, enabling precise analysis of memory requirements.
- **Peak memory breakdown**: The profiler generates detailed visualizations showing where and how memory is used throughout training.

Below is the memory profile of ResNet before implementing activation checkpointing:

This visualization clearly shows how activation memory accumulates during the forward pass and dominates the peak memory usage at the boundary between forward and backward passes.

### Activation Checkpointing Algorithm

**a) Problem framing**: The key challenge is determining which activations to save during the forward pass and which to recompute during the backward pass, optimizing the trade-off between memory savings and computational overhead.

**b) High-level solution**: I implemented the μ-TWO algorithm, which identifies checkpointing candidates based on memory usage and computational cost. The algorithm aims to minimize peak memory while keeping the additional computation time within acceptable bounds.

**c) Deeper details**: The algorithm works by:

1. Analyzing the computational graph to identify potential checkpointing points
2. Estimating the memory savings and computational cost for each potential checkpoint
3. Selecting an optimal set of checkpoints that maximizes memory savings while minimizing computational overhead

After implementing activation checkpointing, the memory profile for ResNet shows significant reductions in peak memory usage:

The visualization clearly demonstrates how activation checkpointing reduces peak memory by recomputing activations during the backward pass instead of storing them throughout training.

### Subgraph Extraction and Rewriting

**a) Problem framing**: For each activation we choose to discard, we need to extract the subgraph that computes it and then reinsert this computation at the appropriate point in the backward pass.

**b) High-level solution**: I developed a subgraph extraction system that identifies all operations required to recompute a given activation, then rewrites the computational graph to include these recomputations at the appropriate points during backpropagation.

**c) Deeper details**: The implementation involves:

1. Identifying the operations that produce a given activation
2. Extracting all dependencies required for recomputation
3. Creating a recomputation function that reproduces the activation when needed
4. Inserting this recomputation at the appropriate point in the backward pass

The approach was applied to both ResNet and Transformer architectures, with architecture-specific optimizations.

### Batch Size Analysis

**a) Problem framing**: A key benefit of activation checkpointing is enabling larger batch sizes on memory-constrained hardware. I needed to quantify this relationship for both baseline and checkpointed models.

**b) High-level solution**: I conducted a comparative analysis of peak memory usage across different batch sizes for both ResNet and Transformer models, with and without activation checkpointing.

**c) Deeper details**: The analysis reveals the relationship between batch size and memory usage:

![ResNet Peak Memory vs Batch Size](Peak vs batch.png)

This graph demonstrates how memory usage scales with batch size for the baseline ResNet. Without optimization, memory increases linearly with batch size, quickly exceeding available GPU memory.

When comparing baseline models to those with activation checkpointing, the memory savings become clear:

The comparison shows that activation checkpointing enables significantly larger batch sizes on the same hardware, improving training efficiency.

### Transformer-Specific Optimizations

**a) Problem framing**: Transformer architectures have unique memory patterns, particularly in self-attention layers, requiring specialized optimization strategies.

**b) High-level solution**: I adapted the checkpointing algorithm for transformer architectures, focusing on the memory-intensive attention mechanisms.

**c) Deeper details**: The transformer-specific implementation shows dramatic memory savings:

![Transformer Memory Profile with AC](Transformer memory profile.png)

The transformer memory profile shows how activation checkpointing reduces memory usage even in the complex attention mechanisms of transformer models.

The batch size scaling for transformers also shows significant improvements:

This visualization demonstrates that activation checkpointing enables much larger batch sizes for transformer models, which are typically even more memory-constrained than CNNs.

## 4. Challenges and Solutions

- **PyTorch Hook Compatibility**: PyTorch's hook API has changed across versions, requiring careful design for compatibility with modern PyTorch versions.

- **Inplace Operations**: Inplace operations interfere with activation checkpointing by modifying tensors that might need recomputation. I had to identify and convert all inplace operations to non-inplace versions.

- **Gradient Accumulation**: Ensuring correct gradient computation when recomputing activations required careful management of autograd contexts and the computation graph.

- **Memory Fragmentation**: Memory fragmentation can reduce the effectiveness of checkpointing. I implemented memory defragmentation strategies to maximize available contiguous memory.

- **Computational Overhead Balance**: Finding the optimal balance between memory savings and computational overhead required extensive experimentation and tuning of the checkpointing algorithm.

- **Architecture-Specific Challenges**: Different model architectures required tailored approaches to checkpointing. For example:
  - ResNet benefited from checkpointing at residual block boundaries
  - Transformers required specialized handling of attention mechanisms and layer normalization

## 5. Results and Analysis

The implementation of activation checkpointing demonstrated significant memory savings across both architectures:

- **ResNet Memory Reduction**: Peak memory usage was reduced by approximately 45-60% for ResNet models, enabling batch sizes 2-2.5x larger than baseline.

- **Transformer Memory Reduction**: For transformer models, memory savings were even more substantial, with 50-70% reductions in peak memory enabling batch sizes up to 3x larger than baseline.

- **Computational Overhead**: The additional computation time from recomputing activations was generally in the 20-30% range, which is an acceptable trade-off given the substantial memory savings.

- **Scaling Efficiency**: The memory efficiency gains were consistent across model sizes and batch sizes, demonstrating the scalability of the approach.

These results validate the effectiveness of activation checkpointing as a strategy for optimizing the memory-computation trade-off in deep neural network training.

## 6. Conclusions and Future Work

- **Dynamic Checkpointing**: Implementing adaptive checkpointing strategies that adjust during training based on observed memory usage patterns.

Overall, this project demonstrates that activation checkpointing is a powerful technique for addressing the memory constraints in deep learning, enabling researchers and practitioners to train larger, more complex models on existing hardware.
